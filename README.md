# Overview
## Back in 2018 I was given an assignment during my college game design classes.
I had 6 months to learn how to and actually make a game demo from scratch.
I had zero Godot knowledge and I had never coded anything seriously before, so that was my very first step into the real programming world.
I didn't want to get any assets from the internet so I decided to make my own. The only exceptions were the music which was ripped straight from the Mega Man X series (kudos to Capcom) and some other SFX which I found and edited heavily.

# Disclaimer
I intend to make absolutely **NO PROFIT** from this project. It was made for learning and entertainment purposes. I only claim ownership of all the graphics used as they were all made/designed by me.

# History
This is the only release available as I have no plans to continue development due to time constraints.
Perhaps in the future I'll have another go.

# Notes
As stated before I had literally just started programming and pretty much learned everything on the fly, so if you do look deep into the code, you'll see some horrendous decisions I took at the time. I am well aware of them and I wouldn't ever repeat them anywhere else.
